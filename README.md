# DevPort - Modern Developer Portfolio Template

Thank you for purchasing the DevPort Portfolio Template! This is a responsive, high-performance HTML5/CSS3 template designed for developers, designers, and freelancers.

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `index.html`    - The main file containing all the content.
- `css/`          - Contains the stylesheet (style.css).
- `js/`           - Contains the main javascript file (script.js).

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Unzip** the downloaded folder.
2. Open the folder and double-click `index.html` to view the site in your browser.
3. Open the folder in your code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.) to start editing.

## 🛠 How to Customize

### 1. Changing Personal Info
Open `index.html` and look for the comment ``.
- Change "Senior Full-Stack Engineer" to your title.
- Update the social links (GitHub, LinkedIn) in the `href="#"` attributes.

### 2. Updating Skills
Scroll to the `` section. The skills are categorized (Frontend, Backend, DevOps).
You can copy/paste the `<li>` or `<div>` blocks to add more skills or delete the ones you don't need.

### 3. Contact Form
The contact form is a static HTML frontend. To make it functional, we recommend using a free service like **Formspree** or **EmailJS**.
- Go to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io) and create a free form.
- Copy your unique endpoint URL.
- In `index.html`, find the `<form>` tag and paste it:
  `<form action="YOUR_FORMSPREE_URL" method="POST">`
